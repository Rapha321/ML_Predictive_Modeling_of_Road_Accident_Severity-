Predictive Modeling of Road Accident Severity
This project was completed as part of the Machine Learning Course in the Data Science Certificate program at the University of Waterloo.

Project Overview
This repository contains the work for a project focused on building a predictive model to classify the severity of road accidents in Montréal, Quebéc. Using a comprehensive dataset of over 200,000 accident records, the project's objective was to create a machine learning system capable of categorizing accidents into five distinct severity levels. The analysis and modeling addressed the key challenge of class imbalance, where fatal and serious injury accidents are rare events, with a focus on creating a model that can accurately identify these high-impact outcomes.
